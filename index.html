<p>Emma, the team's captain, has played a part in all five SEASAC victories, playing for the first time and scoring in the final when she was in Year 8. Now in Year 12 she was once again an outstanding player in the tournament, scoring a hat trick in the final. Emma had this to say: "SEASAC football is always the highlight of my year. This year was a tough tournament with a rough start on day one. Our team is one of the newest, yet strongest squads I have played for, with team members spanning over six year groups. It was such an achievement for all of us to keep the five year winning streak alive and we hope we can continue the tradition next year!"

<p>Tanglin's win is testament of its quality education: each of Tanglin's schools are inspected every three years, following UK Ofsted British Schools Overseas (BSO) standards. The school has been repeatedly described by UK inspectors as Outstanding, the highest possible grade. This outcome is the result of carefully curated curriculum, which draws strongly from the rigour of the English National Curriculum, from Infant through Senior School. As one of the few not-for-profit schools in Singapore, all fees are devoted to providing an outstanding education to Tanglin's students.

Team Alicia F, Dishan K and Vittoria M came in 3rd overall team in the Senior Division. Zhai Z also achieved excellently, with 4th place overall in the Junior Division. Sharbani U, Anne Y and Samantha Y were awarded 1st place overall in Debate (Junior Division). All of our students achieved medals for excellent performances in particular areas, and I am very proud of all of them. Most importantly, they all had a fantastic time: the atmosphere was truly electric, and it was wonderful to see students engaging so excitedly and with such determination.

  Tanglin Trust School’s new state-of-the-art building looks set to be super impressive. The new 11-storey building is slated to open in August 2022 and will accommodate almost a quarter of the total floor space on campus. This means lots of new facilities and an expansion of co-curricular activities for Infant, Junior and Senior students, as well as their families to help integrate everyone in Tanglin’s community.
